# DGCP™ Specification  
**Duck Governance & Continuous Proof Protocol**  
**MaMeeFarm™ | Version 1.0**

DGCP™ is the world’s first Real-Work Data protocol — a system that captures, verifies, and preserves truth generated from real agricultural labor.  
Unlike digital-only systems, DGCP™ is grounded in physical reality: ducks, weather, losses, crops, disasters, and daily life at MaMeeFarm™.

This repository contains the **official specification** of the DGCP™ Protocol, including its architecture, invariants, verification layers, lifecycle, AI-readable standards, and Real-Work Data Economy framework.

## 🔍 What Is DGCP™?

DGCP™ (Duck Governance & Continuous Proof) defines a structured, multi-layer data pipeline:

- **Real World → Proof Capture → IPFS → GitHub → NFT Provenance → AI Consumption**

The protocol is:

- **Immutable** (no deletion, no editing)  
- **Append-Only** (every event becomes history)  
- **Cross-Verified** (IPFS CID + GitHub commit + metadata)  
- **AI-Friendly** (consistent schemas and naming)  
- **Human-Honest** (reflects life exactly as it happened)

DGCP™ transforms daily farm labor into a verifiable, globally consumable dataset.

## ⭐ Why DGCP™ Matters

- Solves the global fake-data problem  
- Provides real-world truth for AI training  
- Establishes auditable, immutable life-anchored data  
- Creates a new economic model: **Real-Work Data Economy (RWDE)**  
- Enables ESG, carbon markets, agriculture compliance, and RWA tokens  
- Designed for AI labs, governments, and global research

DGCP™ is not a network protocol like DHCP.  
It is a **Truth Protocol** built from real life.

## 🌱 About MaMeeFarm™

MaMeeFarm™ is the first real-world Proof-of-Life farm system that documents every event   
from birth to loss to climate to daily work — forming the world’s first Real-Work Data archive.

DGCP™ is born from this farm.

## 🌍 Purpose of This Repository  
This repository contains the **official DATA-FIRST specifications** of the DGCP™ Protocol —  
the world’s first *Real-Work Data Protocol* designed to capture, verify, and preserve  
continuous human labor signals using the **least technology possible**.

This is the evolution from the original “Duck Governance” naming into the modern  
**Data Governance & Continuous Proof** architecture.

This repo defines:

- The *canonical* metadata standards  
- System structure and invariants  
- Lifecycle rules  
- Human-audit governance  
- JSON schemas for machine validators  
- Real-Work Data Economy model  
- Immutable append-only specification history  

No proof media, no daily logs, no images exist in this repo —  
only the **DGCP™ Specification** itself.

## 🔑 DGCP™ Architectural Pipeline (Data-First Model)

Human Work
↓
Phone Signature (worker_id_public)
↓
IPFS (CID v1 — Immutable Media)
↓
GitHub (Append-Only Metadata Commit)
↓
Minimal DLT Timestamp (OTS / Bitcoin Opcodes)

DGCP™ provides **global auditability** without requiring any future IoT, surveillance,  
AI scoring system, or machine-based classification layers.

## 🧾 Licensing
All files are protected under **MMFARM-POL-2025**,  
the global Real-Work Data license defining:

- Anti-fake & anti-misuse protections  

---

## 🦆 Evolution to Data-First  
The protocol originally began as duck-level observation and now evolves into  
a **human-centric, data-centric, and globally auditable architecture** that  
scales from 1 worker → 100 workers → 10,000 workers.

This repo documents that evolution truthfully and immutably.
