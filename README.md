# DGCP™ Specification  
**Duck Governance & Continuous Proof Protocol**  
**MaMeeFarm™ | Version 1.0**

DGCP™ is the world’s first Real-Work Data protocol — a system that captures, verifies, and preserves truth generated from real agricultural labor.  
Unlike digital-only systems, DGCP™ is grounded in physical reality: ducks, weather, losses, crops, disasters, and daily life at MaMeeFarm™.

This repository contains the **official specification** of the DGCP™ Protocol, including its architecture, invariants, verification layers, lifecycle, AI-readable standards, and Real-Work Data Economy framework.

## 🔍 What Is DGCP™?

DGCP™ (Duck Governance & Continuous Proof) defines a structured, multi-layer data pipeline:

- **Real World → Proof Capture → IPFS → GitHub → NFT Provenance → AI Consumption**

The protocol is:

- **Immutable** (no deletion, no editing)  
- **Append-Only** (every event becomes history)  
- **Cross-Verified** (IPFS CID + GitHub commit + metadata)  
- **AI-Friendly** (consistent schemas and naming)  
- **Human-Honest** (reflects life exactly as it happened)

DGCP™ transforms daily farm labor into a verifiable, globally consumable dataset.

## ⭐ Why DGCP™ Matters

- Solves the global fake-data problem  
- Provides real-world truth for AI training  
- Establishes auditable, immutable life-anchored data  
- Creates a new economic model: **Real-Work Data Economy (RWDE)**  
- Enables ESG, carbon markets, agriculture compliance, and RWA tokens  
- Designed for AI labs, governments, and global research

DGCP™ is not a network protocol like DHCP.  
It is a **Truth Protocol** built from real life.
