# DGCP™ — Unbreakable Trust Rules (Invariants)
Version: 1.0  
License: MMFARM-POL-2025  

These are the core invariants of the DGCP™ protocol.  
If any of these rules are broken, the system is no longer DGCP.

---

## 1. Append-Only History

- No deletion of proofs  
- No overwriting of Git history  
- Corrections use new proofs with `correction_of` links  

---

## 2. Human-First Proof

- Proof origin must be a human worker  
- No mandatory IoT sensors, no biometric surveillance  
- Phone + IPFS + GitHub is always sufficient to participate  

---

## 3. Machine Cannot Overrule Human

- Validators only check structure & signatures  
- Machines never decide “truth”, “fraud”, or “value of work”  
- Final decisions belong to human governance groups  

---

## 4. Minimal DLT Dependence

- DLT used only as a time-stamp anchor for SHA256 roots  
- No token economics required  
- No dependency on any single chain for protocol survival  

---

## 5. License & Data Rights

- All proofs are protected under **MMFARM-POL-2025**  
- Reuse must respect the license and worker rights  
- Any derivative AI models must honour the same license conditions  

---

These invariants define the **trust boundary** of DGCP™.  
Any implementation that violates them is considered **non-compliant**.
