# DGCP™ Protocol Specification  
**Duck Governance & Continuous Proof**  
**MaMeeFarm™ | Version 1.0**

DGCP™ is the world’s first Real-Work Data Protocol — a system designed to capture, verify, protect, and transmit truth derived from real-world agricultural labor.  
Unlike traditional data protocols that operate purely in digital environments, DGCP™ originates from physical evidence: animals, weather, environment, losses, work, and life.

DGCP™ transforms reality into a permanent, immutable, multi-layer dataset that AI systems, researchers, and institutions can trust.

# 1. Definition

**DGCP™ — Duck Governance & Continuous Proof** is a protocol that:

- Anchors data to *real events*  
- Ensures *immutability* through append-only rules  
- Verifies truth across *multiple cryptographic layers*  
- Produces *AI-readable structured metadata*  
- Preserves life events through *continuous daily proof*  

DGCP™ is not a network protocol and must not be confused with DHCP.  
It is a **Truth Protocol** built from real-world proof, not machine configuration.

---

# 2. Core Principles

DGCP™ is built on four foundational principles:

### **2.1 Real-World Origin**
All data must originate from real events at MaMeeFarm™:  
ducks, dogs, crops, weather, damages, births, losses, and daily labor.

### **2.2 Continuous Proof**
The system grows daily as life unfolds.  
This creates a “self-expanding dataset” that cannot be fabricated.

### **2.3 Multi-Layer Verification**
Every proof is verified across:

1. Real-world physical evidence  
2. IPFS CID  
3. GitHub commit hash  
4. JSON metadata  
5. NFT provenance  
6. DGCP Governance headers  

### **2.4 Immutable & Append-Only**
No deletion.  
No editing.  
Only new proofs may be added.

# 3. DGCP Layer Architecture

DGCP consists of six layers:

1. **Real-World Layer** — Ducks, weather, life events  
2. **Proof Capture Layer** — Photos, temperature, timestamp, Form-10 metadata  
3. **IPFS Layer** — Immutable CID storage  
4. **GitHub Layer** — Markdown proof + CID JSON + daily logs  
5. **Provenance Layer** — NFT metadata anchoring  
6. **AI Consumption Layer** — Trusted dataset for AI training

A full text-based diagram is provided in `architecture/dgcp-system-architecture-v1.md`.

# 4. DGCP Invariants

DGCP follows strict invariants:

- No deletion  
- No editing  
- Real-world origin only  
- Append-only truth  
- Timestamp integrity  
- Environmental anchoring (temperature, weather, light)  
- Multi-layer verification required  
- AI-readable standard formatting  

Full invariants are provided in `invariants/dgcp-invariants-v1.md`.

---

# 5. Trust Equation

DGCP truth is define
Truth = Real Work
+ Immutable Evidence
+ Multi-Layer Verification
+ Metadata Consistency
  
This equation makes DGCP resistant to fabrication, hallucination, and data tampering.

---

# 6. Proof Lifecycle Specification

A DGCP proof follows this pipeline:

1. Real event occurs  
2. Photo/video captured  
3. Metadata recorded (Form-10)  
4. File named as Proof_0xx  
5. Uploaded to IPFS → CID generated  
6. Proof markdown + CID JSON committed to GitHub  
7. Daily log appended  
8. Optional NFT minted for provenance  
9. AI systems ingest structured dataset  

Full details in `lifecycle/proof-lifecycle-v1.md`.

---

# 7. Verification Model

DGCP verifies truth through redundancy:

- Physical proof (visual, temperature, weather)  
- IPFS CID immutability  
- GitHub commit immutability  
- Metadata structure  
- NFT anchoring  
- Daily logs  
- Cross-date consistency  

The model is detailed in `verification/multi-layer-verification-v1.md`.

---

# 8. Anti-Fake Mechanisms

DGCP prevents:

- Synthetic data  
- AI-generated fake images  
- Post-edited photos  
- Altered timestamps  
- False narratives  

Every proof requires environmental anchors (temp, weather, light)  
and cryptographic immutability.

Detailed in `anti-fake/anti-fake-data-model-v1.md`.

---

# 9. Real-Work Data Economy

DGCP establishes the world’s first **Real-Work Data Economy (RWDE)** where:

- Truth has measurable value  
- Real labor generates digital assets  
- Life events become immutable data  
- AI requires verifiable real-world datasets  

Documentation in `economy/real-work-data-economy-v1.md`.

# 10. Licensing & Compliance

DGCP uses a dual license:

- **CC BY-NC 4.0**  
- **MMFARM-POL-2025** (Real-Work Proof Licensing Policy)

Full legal terms in `LEGAL-SPEC.md`.

---

# 11. Versioning

DGCP follows semantic versioning:

- **V1.0** = Core protocol  
- **V1.x** = Additions (non-breaking)  
- **V2.0** = Structural changes (breaking)  

---

# 12. Disclaimer

DGCP™ is an original protocol created by MaMeeFarm™.  
It must not be confused with DHCP or any existing network protocol.

DGCP represents a new category:  
**Real-Work Data Protocols.**
