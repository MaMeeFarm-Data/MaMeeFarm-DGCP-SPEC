# DGCP™ Operational Flow  
**Duck Governance & Continuous Proof Protocol**  
**Real-Work Data Capture → Verification → Publication Pipeline**

This specification defines the *actual operational workflow* used at MaMeeFarm™  
to capture, freeze, verify, and publish Real-Work Data using DGCP™ Protocol.

This is the ground-truth workflow — designed from daily practice, not theory.

---

# 1. Real-World Event (L1)

DGCP begins with **real work**:

- feeding ducks  
- collecting eggs  
- farm disasters (rain, storm, banana trees fallen)  
- dog activity  
- planting  
- inspections  
- injuries, losses, returns (e.g., Duck #3 returning)  

Everything starts with **physical reality**, not digital input.

No synthetic or reconstructed data is ever permitted.

---

# 2. Capture Layer (L2)

Every event must be captured with:

- Photo / Video evidence  
- Real timestamp  
- Real temperature  
- Real weather  
- Light condition  
- Contextual English notes  

This ensures evidence originates *on the farm*, not generated by AI.

Capture = raw truth.

---

# 3. Immutable Storage (IPFS via Pinata) — (L3)

All media files are uploaded to **Pinata → IPFS**.

Each upload generates:

- **CID** (immutable)  
- **Gateway link**  
- **Permanent timestamp**  

CID is the first cryptographic fingerprint.

If the file changes → CID changes → tampering detected instantly.

---

# 4. Structured Metadata Entry (Google Form → Google Sheet) — (L6)

After uploading to IPFS, p’Toh enters the 10 standard fields:

1. Proof ID  
2. IPFS Link  
3. CID  
4. Filename  
5. Date (YYYY-MM-DD)  
6. Time (HH:MM)  
7. Temperature  
8. Weather  
9. Light Condition  
10. Notes (English)

Google Sheet =  
**The DGCP Raw Data Lake (Metadata Layer).**

It is the single place where AI and humans can read structured truth instantly.

---

# 5. NFT Selection (Optional Layer)

Some proofs are selected for minting on OpenSea:

- Uses CID directly  
- Uses metadata from Google Sheet  
- Produces NFT token  
- Stored on-chain (Polygon)  
- Verifiable via Polygonscan  

This creates the **DGCP RWA Provenance Layer**.

Minting is optional but increases trust.

---

# 6. GitHub Append-Only Proof Archive (L4 + L5)

P’Toh publishes every proof into GitHub:

### Files:
proof/proof_0xx.md
cid/proof_0xx_cid.json
daily/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-log.md

GitHub provides:

- **Append-only history**  
- **Commit hash timeline**  
- **No delete / no rewrite / no override**  
- **Cross-verifiable timestamps**  

GitHub =  
**Canonical Source of Truth for DGCP™.**

Nothing overrides GitHub.

---

# 7. SHA-256 File Fingerprinting (L4)

Each proof file receives:

- SHA-256 hash  
- Stored in `verification/hashes/`  

SHA-256 provides:

- independent integrity check  
- detect any modified proof  
- detect any changed JSON  
- detect any edited log  

Even if GitHub or IPFS are compromised → SHA-256 catches tampering.

---

# 8. Blogger Public Attestation (Optional Layer)

Blogger replaces TikTok as the main public trace.

Why?

- Permanent  
- Google indexed  
- AI-readable  
- Timestamp proof  
- No algorithm suppression  
- No community guideline bans  
- Long-form explanation allowed  

Blogger becomes:

**DGCP Public Narrative Layer (L7)**  
Used for transparency, not verification.

---

# 9. Optional TikTok Layer (Social Narrative)

TikTok is no longer required for DGCP verification.

It becomes:

- a community channel  
- for story  
- emotion  
- outreach  

Not part of the proof chain.

---

# 10. Multi-Layer Verification (AI + Human)

DGCP proof is valid only if all layers match:

- Real-world event  
- Capture evidence  
- IPFS CID  
- Metadata  
- GitHub commit  
- SHA-256 hash  
- Optional Blockchain  
- Optional Blogger timestamp  

AI runs cross-verification across all layers to detect:

- anomalies  
- inconsistencies  
- timeline mismatches  
- synthetic artifacts  
- altered metadata  
- tampered media  

This is the world’s strongest real-life data verification chain.
